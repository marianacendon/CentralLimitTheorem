Conclusions:

The progression from the messy data to the clean one can be seen gradually from the positive extreme skewed histogram of the bk data frame of the variable sale.price.n.
When we look at the graphical displays on Conclusion.Rmd) for bk.sale$gross.sqft, bk.sale$sale.price.n we can see a tendency to a straight line, but most of the values are clustered in the lower left side of the graph so it is difficult to get a conclusion from this, except the presence of outliers.
  Doing a log base 10 plot for bk.sale$gross.sqft, bk.sale$sale.price.n did result in a more "linear" trend that is visible, although it also created the problem of excessive and  all over the place outliers.
  By selecting only those 1, 2, 3 Family homes from the variable building.class.category, we can definitely see that the "linear" trend is more defined and evident, although there are still plenty of outliers present.
  By eliminating outliers, considering only those homes below 100,000, and doing just a log plot on bk.homes$gross.sqft, and bk.homes$sale.price.n we can see a cleaner plot in which there is an positive upward linear trend. 
  The progression between the presence outliers to a clean plot is evident after looking at the last plot.
